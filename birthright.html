          The Challenge: Take an intensive 10 day young adult adventure program and create an accessible version for individuals with cognitive and/or developmental disabilities.

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>
            My research process included interviews with neurotypical participants, parent and caregiver interviews, potential participant interviews, itinerary Reviews and field observations. This helped me to gain an understanding of what the
            typical program entailed and where participants experienced both pleasure and pain points. I observed potential participants in their active social environments. This helped me glean insight into the types of challenges they encounter in
            the real world and what kinds of support were most effective.

          <h3>Ideation</h3>
          <p>
            Research findings showed that young adults on the trips designed for typically developing individuals found the two most meaningful elements of the trip to be deep social emotional connection with peers and a sense of shared adventure.
            The two greatest concerns of parents and caregivers were for the safety of the individual with a disability and having them experience social isolation. Many of the typical itineraries included a mixture of activities that were either
            inaccessible for our participants or did not meet their cognitive strengths and activities that would be appropriate for our participant base with little or no modification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Hypothesis:
            By gathering a well rounded personal profile on each participant and increasing trained staff to participant ratio we could provide a safer, more supportive environment. And through careful selection of accessible and appropriate
            activities we would be able to successfully support individuals with developmental disabilities on a modified travel adventure experience.

          <h3>Understanding Accessibility and Inclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Building Participant Profiles: We began by gathering background information on each potential participant through a 3 part intake process. First we would interview the participantâ€™s primary caregiver to build a foundation. From there
            were would speak with a minimum of 2 alternative caregivers who know the participant in a setting outside of their home to add to the depth of our information base. For participants with significant health or mental health considerations
            we would include the appropriate healthcare professional in our references. After building a baseline profile, we conducted a semi-structured video chat interview with each potential participant. All of this information was then built
            into a staff training module.
          </p>
          <p>
            Staff Training Program:
            Using the information gathered during the research process we curated a staff of individuals who had prior experience working with individuals from our target population. We then created an orientation process to address the specific
            details of our program. The program continued throughout the weeks leading up to the trip and on the trip itself with scheduled full staff meetings, individual and group debriefings and continued training.

          <h3>Pilot Program</h3>
          <p>
            Using an iterative approach we created multiple options for pilot prgrams based on participant profiles we created using real potential participants. We tested our hypothesis using these pilot type programs.
            </p>
            <p>
            We first piloted the program by having individuals who matched our participant profile participate in weekend programs that included an overnight sleepover. Although we could not simulate an overseas experience and account for all potential possibilities, this
            simulation did help us create a basic pilot for the foundation of our program. Each trip to Israel since has served as an iteration as we continue to develop and expand our model.

          <p>
            By using a Human Centered Design approach we were able to create a sustainable, accessible trip experience that meets the needs of our target demographic. We have successfully completed 5 accessible Birthright Israel trips using this
            inclusive model! To date a total of 120 young adults with cognitive and neurodevelopmental disabilities have participated in our program.
